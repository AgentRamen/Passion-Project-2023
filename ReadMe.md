The purpose of this project was to <mark style="background: -webkit-linear-gradient(right, cyan, #E6F3FE); -webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;">devise</mark> and <mark style="background: -webkit-linear-gradient(right, #2DE662, #A5FFE5); -webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;">develop</mark> - through code - any type of project that appeals to ourselves. For this project, I have created a <mark style="background: -webkit-linear-gradient(right, #C883D9, #A6D3FF); -webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;">web-based medical chatbot</mark> that uses conditional rule-making to justify responses to the user.
